# freertos_c28x
FreeRTOS port for TI C2000's C28x based microcontrollers TMS320 family.

Compiled in CCS v6.1.2. FreeRTOS v9.0.0.
Developed and tested on following MCUs:
 * TMS320F28377S
 * TMS320F28034
 * TMS320F28069

Should work with any TMS320 MCU and any futher version of FreeRTOS.

This project contains FreeRTOS, port and simple examples for TMS320F28377S and TMS320F28034.
Examples needs TI's controlSUITE to be installed for both MCU and project settings
should be adjusted to let compiler find device support files.
